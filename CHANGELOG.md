# Changelog

All notable changes to Argus are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.3.0 — Unreleased

Bytecode-analysis precision improvements and one new analysis built on
top of them. Implements the punch list from the post-prune gap audit.

### Added

- **`deferred_startup_deadlock` analysis** — narrowly-scoped detector
  for three `handle_continue/2` patterns: mutual continue cycles
  between two GenServers, continue calls to a sibling started later
  under `:one_for_one`, and continue calls back into the parent
  supervisor while it's still mid-`start_link`. Plus a separate
  `continue_crash_loop_risk` finding for defensively-wrapped variants
  (try/catch :exit) that catch the literal deadlock but create
  supervisor restart loops. Verified zero false positives against the
  ~100-project sample corpus, including Oban.
- **`gen_event` extractor** — covers `:gen_event.sync_notify/2`,
  `notify/2`, `call/3,4`, `add_handler/3`, `add_sup_handler/3`. Reuses
  `sync_call`/`async_cast` so existing analyses (`call_cycle`,
  `process_bottleneck`) automatically catch gen_event patterns.
- **PartitionSupervisor child shape support** — `{PartitionSupervisor,
  child_spec: SomeWorker}` now extracts to the underlying worker
  module instead of treating PartitionSupervisor as the worker.
- **DynamicSupervisor.start_child extraction** — adds a new
  `dynamic_child(sup, child_mod, caller_func)` fact and extends
  `child_subtree` so `one_for_one_coupling` and friends see workers
  added at runtime (oban Midwife, Phoenix Channels, Plug.Upload).
- **`closure_def` Layer 1 fact** — every `make_fun3` instruction now
  emits an edge from the parent function to the lifted closure body.
  Treated as a static call edge in the call graph, so `call_reachable`
  follows execution into closures passed to `Enum.map`,
  `:telemetry.span`, `Task.async`, `Phoenix.PubSub` callbacks, etc.
  Concrete fix: `Oban.Peers.Global.handle_info → :global.set_lock`,
  which lives inside a telemetry-span closure, is now reachable.
- **Function-entry barrier and `arg_position/3` helper** — backward
  resolution can now distinguish function parameters from "I don't
  know" without changing `resolve_register/3`'s value contract.
- **Pattern-matched destructuring resolution** — `{:ok, val} = call()`
  resolves to `{:call_field, "Mod:func/arity", 1}` instead of
  `:dynamic`. Foundation for future analyses that correlate
  destructured values with their originating call sites.
- **Pure-BIF whitelist** — `:erlang.element/2`, `tuple_size/1`,
  `length/1`, `byte_size/1`, `atom_to_binary/1`, `++/2`, `hd/1`,
  `tl/1`, `map_size/1`. Resolves to literals when args are statically
  known, otherwise falls back to `:dynamic`.
- **`:via` tuple resolution in OTP** — `GenServer.call({:via, Registry,
  {MyApp.Registry, key}}, _)` now emits a `sync_call_via` fact and
  tags the legacy `sync_call` with `"via:RegistryInstance"` so existing
  analyses can group calls to the same via target.
- **`:global` retries-aware blocking classification** — new `global_op`
  fact captures `:global.set_lock`, `:global.trans`, `:global.del_lock`
  with the resolved retries argument. Datalog rules derive
  `global_blocking_op` only when retries is `"infinity"` or a positive
  integer (NOT `"0"`), so non-blocking try-locks like
  `:global.set_lock(_, _, 0)` are correctly not flagged.
- **`Process.send_after` / `:timer.send_after` / `:timer.apply_after`
  tracking** — new `delayed_message(sender_func, target, message)`
  fact captures implicit `handle_info` sources. Self() targets are
  recognized via the new `last_call_writer/3` helper.
- **`GenServer.reply/2` `deferred_reply` fact** — infrastructure-only;
  no analysis consumes it yet but documents the deferred-reply pattern
  for future timeout-window analysis.
- **`named_process` emission** — ProcessRegistry now actually emits
  the schema-defined relation it previously only documented.
- **Layer 1 emit additions** — `tuple_field_access(id, src, idx, dst)`
  captures `get_tuple_element` indices, `type_test(id, name, src, fail)`
  captures unary type-test names that the generic `branch` fact
  discarded, and `unhandled_op(id, op)` records every opcode that
  fell through the catch-all (so production runs surface what we're
  silently dropping).

### Changed

- **`scripts/analyze_project.exs`** — `:deferred_startup_deadlock`
  added to `@correctness_analyses` default set.
- **OTP extractor `:via` tuple handling** — sync calls against
  `{:via, _, _}` targets now emit a structured `sync_call_via` fact
  alongside the legacy `sync_call` (callee tag becomes
  `"via:RegistryInstance"`).
- **Schema cleanup** — dropped `process_monitor` (extracted but never
  consumed). Verified `supervisor.strategy` IS still consumed by
  `one_for_one_coupling` and `supervision` rules, so kept it.

### Notes

`mix argus --list` now shows 15 analyses. The new
`deferred_startup_deadlock` is wired into both the mix task and the
default `analyze_project.exs` correctness set.

## 0.2.0 — Unreleased

A focused refactor: prune the analysis surface from 28 to 14 BEAM/OTP-specific
detectors, clarify pipeline boundaries, and shrink the codebase by ~40%
without losing the bug-finding power that matters.

### Removed

- **12 generic dataflow primitives** — `cfg`, `callgraph`, `callgraph_ctx`,
  `reachability`, `reaching_def`, `liveness`, `dominators`, `loops`,
  `tail_call`, `constant_propagation`, `function_summary`, `message_flow`.
  These were classic compiler dataflow building blocks with no direct
  bug-finding value for end users. The shared rule library that backs the
  kept analyses (`priv/dl/clientlib/`) is preserved.
- **2 non-BEAM analyses** — `phoenix_security` (framework-specific, better
  handled by web tooling) and `resource_lifecycle` (generic, high false-
  positive risk).
- **`Argus.Souffle` behaviour** — was a 13-line indirection over a single
  `Argus.Souffle.CLI` implementation. Inlined into `Argus.Souffle`.
- **DOT output format from `mix argus`** — only worked for the cut
  cfg/callgraph analyses.
- Orphaned `priv/dl/clientlib/dataflow.dl` and `priv/dl/clientlib/concurrency.dl`.
- Schema relations populated only by removed extractors.

### Changed

- **Pipeline namespace.** `Argus.Extract`, `Argus.Normalize`, and
  `Argus.Emitter` are now `Argus.Pipeline`, `Argus.Pipeline.Normalize`,
  and `Argus.Pipeline.Emit`. A new `Argus.Pipeline.Disassemble` module
  owns module-path resolution and BEAM file loading.
- **Extractor helpers.** New `scan_functions/4`, `scan_remote_calls/4`,
  `resolve_callee/1`, and `resolve_atom/3` helpers in
  `Argus.Extractor.Helpers` removed ~166 lines of duplicated per-instruction
  scan boilerplate across six extractors.
- **`mix argus` discover_dep_modules** now uses `Mix.Project.build_path/0`
  + `Mix.Project.deps_apps/0` instead of a hardcoded `_build/{env}/lib/*/ebin`
  glob. The previous version only worked when each dep had its own `_build`.
- **`mix argus` module discovery** wraps `String.to_existing_atom/1`, so
  stale `.beam` files for unloaded modules are silently skipped instead
  of crashing discovery.
- **README and docs** refreshed to focus on the kept BEAM/OTP analyses,
  with grouped descriptions and a real Oban example.

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

### Notes for upstream users

This is a 0.x project with no published Hex releases. Anyone using
`Argus.Extract`, `Argus.Normalize`, or `Argus.Emitter` directly will need to
update to the `Argus.Pipeline.*` names. Anyone running cut analyses
(`mix argus cfg`, `mix argus callgraph`, etc.) will need to migrate to one
of the kept analyses or write a `mix argus custom` rules file against the
preserved `priv/dl/clientlib/` rule library.

## 0.1.0

Initial research release with 28 analyses spanning generic dataflow primitives,
BEAM/OTP bug detectors, and framework-specific checks.
