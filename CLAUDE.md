## Project overview

Argus is a BEAM program analysis framework: it disassembles compiled `.beam`
files, extracts Datalog facts from the bytecode, and evaluates them with
Souffle. Inspired by Doop (JVM), cclyzer++ (LLVM IR) and Gigahorse (EVM), but
the BEAM's register-based instruction set lets it skip the IR-lifting step
those frameworks need.

### Layout

- `lib/argus/pipeline/` — disassemble (via beam_spy), normalize, and emit
  the generic bytecode facts; `lib/argus/extractors/` — the domain
  extractors; `lib/argus/analyses/` — one module per analysis, declaring
  its extractors, output relations and finding builders.
- `lib/argus/schema.ex` — the fact schema. `@schema_version` is what
  downstream tools key their caches on; `Argus.SchemaVersionTest` pins its
  shape digest, and every bump gets a CHANGELOG entry. `mix argus.gen.dl`
  regenerates `priv/dl/base.dl` and `layer2.dl` from it.
- `priv/dl/stage0.dl` — the call graph derived once per run;
  `priv/dl/clientlib/` — the shared rule library; `priv/dl/analyses/` —
  one Souffle program per analysis.
- `lib/argus/cfg.ex`, `dataflow.ex`, `purity/` — control flow, def-use and
  effect models, also consumed by downstream tools (gloss, planchette).
- `scripts/analyze_project.exs` — analyze an external, compiled project.

### Design principles

- Exhaustive pattern matching on BEAM instructions in `Argus.Pipeline.Emit`.
- Per-module extraction is embarrassingly parallel and deterministic
  (`ordered: true`); the same modules yield `==` facts.
- Stage 0 keeps the volatile instruction-level relations out of every
  analysis's input set; `test/argus/dl_declarations_test.exs` pins each
  analysis's inputs so an incrementality regression cannot land silently.
- Souffle is an external tool on PATH, shelled out to via `Argus.Souffle`.
- Every shipped analysis targets a BEAM-specific bug class. Generic
  vocabulary belongs in `priv/dl/clientlib/`, not in an analysis file.
- Over-approximate in the direction that stays quiet: a fact that cannot
  be sure says `"dynamic"`, and rules ask what is NOT handled.
